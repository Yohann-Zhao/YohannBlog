                    <h3>Why use this site?</h3>
                    <p>Many flight students face difficulties when preparing for theory exams. The main problem lies in study methods: not taking notes, difficulty in grasping key points, leading to low study efficiency.
                        To solve this problem, this site shares my summarized study notes to help students quickly grasp exam key points and improve study efficiency.</p>

                    <h3>How to use this site for study?</h3>
                    <p>This site provides a systematic knowledge framework and refines exam key points to make learning more organized.
                        However, the foundation of all knowledge is still textbooks. Students should fully self-study textbooks and combine the organized content of this site to form their own knowledge system.
                        <!-- In addition, this site provides categorized examples to help students efficiently summarize exam patterns and reduce ineffective practice time, thereby improving exam preparation efficiency.</p> -->

                    <h3>Future development direction of this site</h3>
                    <p>I will continue to improve and update the content of this site in my spare time.
                       In the near future, I will focus on updating theory exam-related content and gradually expand to learning resources for the flight training stage to help flight students comprehensively improve their flight and theory skills.</p>
